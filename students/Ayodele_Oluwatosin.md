<h3>The following are the outcomes of the paper</h3>
 
 1. Of the 546 successfully validated human cancer gene
orthologs,  476 had at least a
1:many relationship (i.e., there are at least two copies of the
gene in at least one mammalian genome)

 2. 293 (53.76%) had three copies in at least one mammalian
genome, 176 (36.33%) had four copies in at least one mammalian genome

 3. 124 (24.95%) had five copies in at least one
mammalian genome, and 45 (8.26%) genes had ten copies in
at least one mammalian genome
